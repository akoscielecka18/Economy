HDI (Human Development Index / Wskaźnik Rozwoju Społecznego) is a measure that shows how well people are living in a particular country. It's calculated based on three things: how long people live (their health), how much education they receive, and how much money they earn (their income). The higher the HDI, the better the living conditions in that country.
